## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sara, a data-driven business analyst. I recently completed a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of California, Irvine, where I learned how to apply different analytical tools, such as machine learning models and neural networks, to real-world examples. Before that, I completed an online Certificate Program in Business Analysis from the University of California, Berkeley, while working as a Technical Administrative Assistant at SFX Preferred Resorts for over 3 years. During the certification program, I learned about business analysis from a business perspective, from communicating with stakeholders and asking the right questions to implementing solutions effectively. As a Technical Administrative Assistant, I was able to apply the knowledge I learned from my academic career, as well as learn new tools and make valuable contributions to an organization.  

So why analytics? Analytics is like creating a narrative for data. It turns the what-seems-to-be-pointless data into valuable information, allowing others to see the story of the dataset. It is the potential to uncover beneath-the-surface insights, supporting strategic decision-making, that draws me to business analytics. I hope to empower people and organizations by bridging the gap between business and analytics.
