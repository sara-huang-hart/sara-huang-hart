## Hi there :wave:

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sara, a data-driven business analyst. I recently completed a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of California, Irvine, where I learned how to apply different analytical tools, such as machine learning models and neural networks, to real-world examples. Before that, I completed an online Certificate Program in Business Analysis from the University of California, Berkeley, where I learned about business analysis from a business perspective, from communicating with stakeholders and asking the right questions to implementing solutions effectively. At the same time, I was working as a full-time Technical Administrative Assistant at SFX Preferred Resorts for over 3 years. In this role, I applied the knowledge I learned from my academic career and made valuable contributions to the organization, as well as learned new skills.    

So why analytics? For me, it's about translating raw data into meaningful insights. I'm drawn to the challenge of transforming what might seem to be random data into a compelling narrative that drives strategic decisions. My goal is to bridge the gap between business and analytics, empowering people and organizations through data-driven insights.

Here are some projects that I have worked on.
